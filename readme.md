## Getting started

Before you can start using any commands, you need to first run `acquia login`. This will write your login details to a local netrc file so that you won't be prompted for login details every time a request is made. After that, the sky is the limit!

## FAQ

**Q:** Is there support for proxies and corporate firewalls?

**A:** By god yes. Proxies and corporate firewalls are the bane of my existence so there was no way this toolbelt _wasn't_ going to support it. To use a proxy, all you need to do is set your HTTPS_PROXY environment variable to the required value. Example:

```bash
$ export HTTPS_PROXY="http://myproxy.url.internal:1234"
```

Then to check the value was correctly set:

```bash
$ echo $HTTPS_PROXY
$ http://myproxy.url.internal:1234
```
